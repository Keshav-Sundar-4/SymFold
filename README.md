# Symmetry Aware Partial Diffusion
A codebase that runs symmetrical partial diffusion on any given input sequence. Automated sequence recovery and symmetrization. No symmetry specification required - the code automatically adjusts to the users need. 

Rotationa matrices etc. are provided. The primary goal of this model is to accurately predict capsid structure using minimal computational means. 

A simple file replacement schematic is shown below - Boltz v0.4.0 is required for proper compatability.

### Install matplotlib
pip install matplotlib

### File Replacements:
Note that these file paths are based on the Filezilla boltz env folder. 

### main.py
Replace: /work/keshavsundar/env/boltz_glycan/lib/python3.10/site-packages/boltz/main.py

### model.py
Replace: /work/keshavsundar/env/boltz_glycan/lib/python3.10/site-packages/boltz/model/model.py

### diffusion.py
Replace: /work/keshavsundar/env/boltz_glycan/lib/python3.10/site-packages/boltz/model/modules/diffusion.py

### symmetry_awareness.py
Add: /work/keshavsundar/env/boltz_glycan/lib/python3.10/site-packages/boltz/data/module/symmetry_awareness.py

### yaml.py
Add: /work/keshavsundar/env/boltz_glycan/lib/python3.10/site-packages/boltz/data/parse/yaml.py

### example_boltz_symmetry_test.sh
Use this file as an example. However, importantly, the setup file generates an accurate yaml. So you can simply use this. Be wary, as this will require changes to the shell script, as you need to call a different yaml if you want to automate this. 

### symmetry_postprocess.py
This is a general postprocessing script to create the full subquotient icosahedron. Note that this will only use chain A of the input file to create said icosahedron. The way to run the script is as follows: 'python symmetry_postprocess.py <input_name>.cif <output_name>.cif --group I'

### RMSD calculation
Yang TO DO

## General Info
Something important is that the partial diffusion set up file creates an output pdb file, which will be your input pdb file. Then, the yaml file it outputs can be the input yaml file in one-shot. No changes are required to the yaml file. Additionally, note that you can cange the amount of partial diffusion steps on line 740. Currently the total number of steps is 200, so the default (50) is t=0.25. diffusion.py is the the file.
